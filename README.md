## 📝 Overview
<img src="DiscoveryParkMapApp/assets/app-card.png" width="800" height="auto" alt="System Overview">

The **Discovery Park Map App** uses **Dijkstra's algorithm** to find the shortest path between two locations within the College of Engineering campus. The app is designed to make it easier for incoming students and faculty to navigate the building and find essential resources such as bathrooms, vending machines, and more.

### Key Highlights

* Indoor navigation using real-time directions
* Find specific resources like restrooms, ATMs, and more
* Cross-platform app available on both iOS and Android
